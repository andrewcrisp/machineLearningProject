	<p>Using wearable sensors, six participants performed barbell lifts both incorrectly and correctly.  The sensors monitored motion from belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.  Collected data includes some metadata, including name of participant, and three dimensional movement measurements.</p>
    <p>A model was built using the xgboost package.  This is a gradient boosting library with parallel tree boosting.  The project page claims that the library is one of the most frequently used by winning machine learning contest teams.</p>
